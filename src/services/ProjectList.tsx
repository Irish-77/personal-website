The AI trained with custom labeled data calculates the value of the coins and tells you how many coins are in the picture and the cumulative value of these coins. The app is used to take the photo, which is sent to the backend. Then the AI (Faster R-CNN with MobileNet Backbone) calculates the value of the coins. Afterwards, the recognized coins are labeled in the app. Using Ngrok, the home computer can be utilized as a server. The app development was not my area of responsibility.'
