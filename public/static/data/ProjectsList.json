Using object detection, people are directly marked on the live stream."

Afterwards, the recognized coins are labeled in the app. Using Ngrok, the home computer can be utilized as a server. The app development was not my area of responsibility."

The core vision behind PyML is to provide a platform for continuous learning and hands-on experience in the realm of machine learning. As I learn or discover new concepts and algorithms, they are meticulously coded and integrated into PyML, contributing to a growing repository of custom-built machine learning tools. While PyML is not intended for production use, as it lacks CUDA support and may not be optimized for speed, it serves as an invaluable educational resource for those looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning algorithms and their inner workings. Whether you're a novice seeking to grasp the fundamentals or an enthusiast keen to explore the nuances of machine learning, PyML welcomes you to join in the journey of learning and building together."
